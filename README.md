# Self-Driving-Car-Agent-with-RL
### A Self Driving Car Agent built using Unity3D and trained using Reinforcement Learning.  
-------------

Welcome to the Self-Driving Car Agent repository! This project utilizes Reinforcement Learning techniques to train an autonomous driving agent in a simulated environment built on Unity3D. The agent learns to navigate through the environment and make driving decisions based on rewards obtained through interaction with the environment.

# Features
- **Reinforcement Learning:** The core of the project is built on reinforcement learning algorithms that enable the agent to learn how to drive autonomously by interacting with the environment.

- **Unity3D Simulation:** The driving environment is simulated using _Unity3D_, providing a realistic platform for training the self-driving agent.

- **Modular Codebase:** The project is organized into subdirectories within the assets directory, including scripts, models, and additional project files, ensuring a well-structured and easily understandable codebase.
